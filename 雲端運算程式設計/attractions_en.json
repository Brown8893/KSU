However, by 1960, with support from the medical community and church, a free clinic was set up. This Blackfoot disease focused clinic was situated within the Jin-he Clinic (金河診所), run by Doctor Wang Jin-he (王金河醫師); who would provide free medical treatment for those suffering from this illness.

The Dutch also developed Chihkan Street (Rua Provintia) to start the commercial history of busy business in Tainan.\r\n\r\nChihkan Tower is the largest landmark of the Chihkan Culture Park covering the east of Xinmei Street, south of Chengkung Road to Minquan Road. In fact, Xinmei Street used to be the coastline of Tainan in the 17th century. Inside the park stand Chihkan Tower, Sidian Da Tianhou (Ritual Grand Heavenly Empress) Temple, Sidian Wumiao (Ritual General Guan Temple) and other historical monuments for visitors to rediscover the historical track of Tainan from Dutch occupation through the Kingdom of Tungning to the Qing dynasty.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nChihkan Tower is the center of development of the old Tainan City. With numerous monuments, the park is one of a few culture parks in Taiwan to see buildings during Dutch occupation through the Kingdom of Tungning. It is noteworthy that there are three national historical monuments in the park. Besides Chihkan Tower specially recommended by The Washington Post in its travel page, the palace of King Ningjing (today&rsquo;s Da Tianhou (Grand Heavenly Empress) Temple) and the Sidian Wumiao (Ritual General Guan Temple) modified from the Guandi (General Guan) Hall of the King Ningjing.

Visitors looking for traditional crafts or traditional gourmet foods will also find the famous food brands, such as Zaifa Steamed Dumplings, Yi Feng Winter Melon Tea, Baibei Milkfish Soup, Qingzhen Duck Soup, Jindechun Tea, Jiuyongruizhen Traditional Bakery, Wuwanchun Incense Shop, Longxingya Zinc Smith, and so on, in the area.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhy is it called Chihkan Tower? Why are there many old-styled business and street food shops near Chihkan Tower? How is the Chihkan Culture Park formed? Visit the Chihkan Culture Park to explore yesteryears Tainan from Dutch occupation through the Kingdom of Tungning to Qing dynasty.\r\n\r\nChihkan Tower was built by the Dutch in 1652. It was a political and economic center called &ldquo;Provintia&rdquo; at the beginning. The &ldquo;province&rdquo; is formed by three near square platform cities. They were remodeled into red-tiled cornices in 1886 with a Wenchang Pavilion, a Haishen (Poseidon) Temple, and the Penghu Academy. Over the past 300 years or so, although these buildings have been improved or repaired many times, their roles and importance in Tainan remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe surviving part of Chihkan Tower is formed by the south garden, the north pavilion, and Penglai Pavilion in the west. In the garden filled with plants stands the statue of Cheng-kung ZHENG&rsquo;s acceptance of the Dutch surrender. At the foundation wall near the garret, there are nine dragon-headed Bixis (stone turtle sculptures) relocated from the side of Dananmen (Great South Gate). On the tablets atop the turtle sculptures recorded the Lin Shuang Wen Incident. These tablets are made in 1788 of granite each erecting on a Bixi (turtle, one of nine sons of the Dragon King characterized by the undertaking heavy duty image) with a double-dragon head. They are commonly called the &ldquo;turtle tablets&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nToday, there are two Minnan-styled buildings standing on the foundation improved from Provintia. The original castle was very small, with one main building and two watchtowers in the south and the north respectively. Currently, only the gate in the west and the wall in the northeastern corner of the castle survive from Dutch occupation. From these ruins, the brick bonding methods are clearly seen. These bricks from Java of Indonesia were bonded with mortar mixed with glutinous rice juice, syrup, sand, and oyster shells.\r\n\r\nInside the garret, the Haishen Temple sits in the south, while the Wenchang Pavilion in the north. Both have a double-eave hip-and-gable roof. The section between the eaves is the second floor decorated by glazed green vase guardrails. At the lintel of the Haishen Temple hangs the &ldquo;Chihkan Tower&rdquo; tablet. Inside the temple is an exhibition hall. The vase-shaped door holes in the east are rather lovely.\r\n\r\nThe tablet with the handwriting of &ldquo;Wenchang Ke&rdquo; (Wenchang Pavilion) of Magistrate Sho-qian SHEN of Taiwan Prefecture is still hung in the pavilion. The first floor is an exhibition hall, while &ldquo;Great Kui the Star Prince&rdquo; is worshipped on the second floor. The deity statue is characterized by a brush (pen) in the right hand, an ink container in the left hand, a foot on a turtle, and another foot supporting a ladle, symbolizing coming in first in examinations. Both buildings are built on a foundation, and dragon-shaped imperial paths are built between foundations. On the wall are the scroll-patterned window lattices.\r\n\r\nAn ancient well stands amidst the pavilion on the second floor. It is said that the well links to Zeelandia. True or not awaits visitors to imagine. &nbsp;The entire raised foundation is surrounded by brick guardrails, and there are lovely cub statutes on guardrails facing south.\r\n\r\nOn the south wall there are stone tablets erected in different eras, and historical artefacts, such as the stone horse, stone weight, and weightlifting stone, are everywhere in the garden. The lobby of the Penghu Academy is a better-preserved building of the Qing dynasty. Facing west with humble decoration, it is worthy of visit.","open_time":"Monday~Sunday 08:30~21:30","district":"West Central Dist.","address":"700, No. 212, Sec. 2, Minzu Rd. , West Central Dist., 臺南市 Taiwan R.O.C","tel":"+886-6-2205647","fax":"","lat":22.99482,"long":120.19645,"services":[],"category":["歷史古蹟","宗教廟宇","地方展館","在地藝文"],"update_time":"2019-11-07 11:31:53"},{"id":5852,"lang":"en","name":"Tainan City Nanying Hakka Culture Museum(臺南市南瀛客家文化會館)","summary":"","introduction":"The Nanying Hakka Culture Museum is composed of two buildings sitting at lot 275, Minzi Section, Xinying District, Tainan City selected by the former Tainan County Government.

Upon the completion in 1640, the city was renamed Fort Zeelandia, including the inner and the outer forts. The inner fort is a three-story square building, with the basement as a warehouse and a bastion at each of the four corners on the upper level of the two above-ground floors. Between each two corners there are the north, east, and south gates. On the lintel of the north gate, the words T&#39;CASTEEL ZEELDIA GEBOUWED ANNO 1634 (Fort Zeelandia Built 1634) are inscribed. &nbsp;A bastion was also built at each corner of the lower level, with a semicircular barrack in the middle of the sides of the foundation, and a well at the center of each semicircular barrack.\r\n\r\nIn the north there is a small gate and a stairway leading to the underground magazine. There are battlements on both the lower and upper levels, on the protruding bastions there are watchtowers and turrets, and each bastion is equipped with five cannons The entire fortress is bonded with mortar made with glutinous rice juice, syrup, sand, and powered oyster shells. Today, a few sections of the city wall and a semicircular bastion survive, and the scale of the remains of the Anping Old Fort is the largest.\r\n\r\nAfter the Portuguese discovered the route from Europe to the Far East via the Cape of Good Hope (Cabo da Boa Esperan&ccedil;a) in the late 15th century, western (European) powers began their eastward movement. &nbsp;First, the Portuguese occupied Macao and set consulates along the southeastern coast of China. Then Spain followed suit, and Japan the next. The Dutch wishing to have trade with the Ming Empire was thus under extreme pressure.\r\n\r\nIn the late 17th century, the Dutch invaded Penghu twice, but all were defeated by the Ming Empire. In September 1623, Admiral Cornelis Reijersen led his troops build a facility at Anping Harbor. The Dutch troop demolished the facility after withdrawing from the place as the Ming Empire fought back to Penghu. In July 1624, the Dutch occupied Taiwan, with Martinus Sonck appointed the first governor, and built a fortress on the old fortress foundation in Yikunshen. In lack of bricks, they built the fortress with sandy soil and other materials and called the place the Orange city. In 1627, they renamed it Zeelandia and progressively changed the materials into bricks. The outcome completed on January 1, 1633 was the beginning of Taiwan City (also called the King&rsquo;s City, Chihkan City, Anping City) . As the city was built by the Dutch, early Han people called it the &ldquo;red hair city&rdquo; because they called the Dutch &ldquo;red hair&rdquo;. After the reconstruction during Japanese colonization, the city has been called Anping Old City until today.\r\n\r\nIn 1661, Cheng-kung ZHENG expelled the Dutch from Taiwan and migrated to Zeelandia. That&rsquo;s why the city is also called the King&rsquo;s City. In 1683, Taiwan became part of the Qing dynasty, and the King&rsquo;s City lost its position and became a naval facility. &nbsp;The city wall was collapsed by a magazine explosion in 1871. As the city has lost its value as a military facility after the explosion, Qing official Bao-zhen SHEN massively disassembled the bricks and rocks of Taiwan City to build the Erkunshen Battery (Eternal Golden Castle today) in 1874. By that time, only ruins remained in Taiwan City. To build the Anping Customs Officers Quarter, the Japanese colonial government built a tall platform on the ruins in 1897. After building western buildings on the platform, they changed the name of the place as Anping Old City. By that time, the original Taiwan City extinguished, except for one ruined city wall standing there witnessing this part of Taiwan&rsquo;s history. (Shih, 1999:48). According to the restoration made by Shunichi Kuriyama in 1936, it seems that there are the inner and outer walls at the corner (outer) city. In addition, besides the said section, there were five more ruined sites of the outer city.\r\n\r\nAt the L-shaped area around Gubao Street, Guosheng Road, Land 85 of Anping Road, and Anbei Road, there are six sections of suspected ruins of Taiwan City.\r\n\r\nOne section hidden behind the civilian residences at Nos. 71, 73, 75, 77, and 79 of Guosheng Road runs parallel to Guosheng Road. This 2m-tall, 38.7-m long, 2m-thick wall with a 2m-wide and 1.5m tall door opening is supposed to the ruin of the northern outer city wall (K.E. Cheng Architect &amp; Associates, 1993:100). The second (0.5m thick) and third sections about 1.5m long and 2.7m tall without known separation hide at No. 67 Guosheng Road and the enclosure wall of the coffin store connected to it. The fourth section about 15.15m long and 5.4m tall of unknown thickness with a trapezoidal shape (narrower top and wider bottom) is located behind the Xilong Temple, and it is suspected to be the ruin of the south bastion west of the corner (outer) city. The fifth and the sixth sections are separated. The fifth one about 7.63m long, 1.81m tall of unknown thickness stands between the northern enclosure wall of the Anlong Temple and No. 67 of Guosheng Road. On the wall there is a calabash-shaped door opening. However, the size of the bricks and the mortar bonding them suggest that this may not be the ruin of Taipei City. The sixth section about 3.18m long, 2m tall, and 0.32m thick is located at the outer enclosure wall off No. 75 Guosheng Road. Most part of it is covered by planters, and its overall shape is unidentified. In conclusion, the ruin is packed between two residences separated by a small seam impassible for measurement of any kind, and further investigation is required.\r\n\r\nIn September 2001, the Tainan City Government implemented the &ldquo;Anping Harbor National Historical Park&rdquo; project. In the non-destructive inspection with ground-penetrating radar performed before project implementation, they found many inner-city sites and conducted an academic historical and archaeological research with fruitful results by integrating architectural, civil engineering, and archaeological technologies. In September 2004, the Tainan City Government included related outer-city sites as &ldquo;city historical sites&rdquo; called the &ldquo;Zeelandia City Wall &amp; Inner-City Buildings Historical Site&rdquo; for preservation and maintenance. The &ldquo;Hall Side Watchtower&rdquo; is a modern building. Looking afar from the tower, we can almost see the coast. Recollecting the Ming troop landing on Luermen, the Dutch Fort Zeelandia in Beixianwei (Bassemboy), or the engagement of the troops of both countries at Redoudt Zeeburch. The merit of Cheng-kung ZHENG has become eternity.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnping Minor Artillery Fort\r\nThe fort is located west of the Taiwan City ruins, and its enclosure stone dike is long and narrow running from the south to the north. The artillery fort includes the fort structure and the enclosure stone dike in the north. Sitting next to the Shuici Park, the fort is made with granite and pebbles with six brick battlements in the south, north, and west sites, with fort floor built with oil-surface bricks. A magazine is in the basement. The fort was originally equipped with the British B.P. 9-pound shell muzzle-loading cannon. The cannons we see today are not the original ones. The stone dike in the north side is built with the coral stone bonded with cement. The loopholes on the surface are equipped with valves to block water. The front section of the dike runs deep inside civilian residences and link to other civilian residences via the open space of the community activity center in the local district. The rear section is the stone dike of the old fort across from the plaza, low civilian buildings, a church, forming a natural defense system with the fish farms in the west.","open_time":"Mondy~Thursday: 8:30-17:30\r\nFriday ~ Sunday（Holidy）: 8:30-20:00","district":"Anping Dist.","address":"708, No. 82, Guosheng Rd., Anping Dist., 臺南市 Taiwan R.O.C","tel":"+886-6-2267348","fax":"","lat":23.0019,"long":120.1607,"services":[],"category":["在地藝文"],"update_time":"2019-11-12 11:13:40"},{"id":5864,"lang":"en","name":"Madou Culture Museum(麻豆文化館)","summary":"","introduction":"The Madou Culture Museum opened in 2001 was built under the &ldquo;one town one culture museum&rdquo; policy promoted by the Council of Cutlural Affairs (now Ministry of Culture).

In 1917, a larger-scale, fully equipped hospital building was built north of the Second Japanese Imperial Infantry Wing (now the Guangfu Campus of National Cheng Kung University) according to the Japanse Imperial Army Permanent Barrack Construction Project Phase III. In 1937, the facility was renamed Tainan Army&rsquo;s Hospital. After Taiwan restoration, the nationalist government took over the hospital in 1948 and founded the Army Training Command Hospital, which began service later in mid-August. The hospital was renamed Taiwan Provincial Army Command Hospital in the following year and restructured into the &ldquo;Army Headquarters Hospital&rdquo; in 1950. Further in October, it was reorganized into the &ldquo;Army Academy Hospital&rdquo;. In March 1952, it was restructured into the &ldquo;Army Independent Hospital&rdquo; and renamed in May the &ldquo;Amy Hospital&rdquo; directly under Army Headquarters. In 1954, the &ldquo;Army Hospital&rdquo; was upgraded to the &ldquo;Combined Logistics Command 4th General Hospital&rdquo; directly under Combined Logistics Headquarters. In 1955, it was transferred to the Medical Affairs Division of the Army Logistics Command and renamed &ldquo;Army 4th General Hospital&rdquo;. In 1960, Army Headquarters renamed the hospital &ldquo;Army 804 General Hospital&rdquo;, or commonly known as the &ldquo;804 Hospital&rdquo; to standardize the number of all Army hospitals. In 2000, the present hospital site was appropriated to the National Cheng Kung University. In 2001, the university completed the planning of the west of its Lixing Campus (original military hospital).\r\n\r\nThe entire Japanese Imperial Army Tainan Hospital is connected by a number of south-north running buildings. Each building is a brick structure with different types of arcades. Small craftily designed air wells are on the roof to adapt to the climate of southern Taiwan and to characterize the building. In additional to the well-defined interior functions, the original Japanese Imperial Army Tainan Hospital included the enclosure wall, air-raid shelter, and landscaping facilities such as the garden, pond, and wooden pavilion. &nbsp;In the 1972 refurbishment project, a stone-stacked rockery, the national emblem of the ROC, and the stone carving &ldquo;毋忘在莒&rdquo; (Never Forget to Restore Mainland China) appeared at the pond northwest of the hospital. These are the best evidence to prove the military hospital role of the facility after Taiwan restoration.\r\n\r\nExcept for the lecture hall building, all other buildings are equipped with vents and stilts, with pebble-wash finish. The wall is made with the Dutch-styled Taiwan Renga bricks. Possible tiles include the cement tile and the black paste-clay tile, with a small number of asbestos boards or metal boards. &nbsp;Water resistance layer is made with wooden tiles, mainly with the Taiwan cypress. Some roofs are equipped with the roof window and air well. In addition to the reinforce concrete slab, the indoor floor has diamond-shaped pebble-wash finish. All windows are hung windows. To facilitate ventilation, windows are large in size and many in quantity. The hallway is spacious to facilitate patient bed movement. The wood slat lime work of the wall is the distinct difference between the original lecture hall and other buildings. There is neither roof window nor air well on the roof, and wood floor tiles are paved indoor. Overall, the entire building is almost a complete wood structure.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Imperial Army Tainan Hospital was a military army was founded by the Japanese army during Japanese colonization first at the Chihkan Tower. Following the completion of related military facilities in the northeastern part of the city, a larger-scale, fully equipped hospital building was built north of the Second Japanese Imperial Infantry Wing (now the Guangfu Campus of National Cheng Kung University). After the restoration of Taiwan, the hospital was handed over to the Armed Forces, which founded the 804 Army hospital to serve citizens and military. It was an important hospital to residents in Zhonglou and Sanfen. In terms of the building&rsquo;s value, it was the only fully-equipped military hospital in Taiwan. After the relocation of the 804 hospital, National Cheng Kung University have acquired the hospital site and turned it into the Lixing Campus for use by related departments after refurbishment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of either mass or spatial layout, the Japanese Imperial Army Tainan Hospital and other military hospitals in Taiwan, or the Japanese Gigu Prefecture Military Hospital are &ldquo;independent&rdquo; from one another, and the Imperial Army Tainan Hospital was one of the kinds. This historical monument covers 7 buildings, including the administration office, 2 patient wards, the auxiliary office, the lecture hall, the infectious disease ward, the laboratory, and the sanitization room. These buildings present the operation of military hospitals during Japanese colonization and reflect the access layout and design logic of hospitals in that time. In addition to buildings, there are many old trees in the hospitals worthy of preservation.\r\n\r\nThe spatial layout of the Japanese Imperial Army Tainan Hospital has a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; design, i.e. each building is designed for a specific purpose, and buildings are connected by means of the arcade. It is the major hospital layout in Taiwan during Japanese colonization. Structurally, all 7 buildings are composed of the red-brick carrying wall and the wooden gable truss to present the architectural features of the Japanse Imperial Army Permanent Barrack Construction Project Phase III.","open_time":"Please contact NCKU","district":"North Dist.","address":"704, No. 25, Xiaodong Rd., North Dist., 臺南市 Taiwan R.O.C","tel":"+886-6-2757575","fax":"","lat":23.00242,"long":120.21564,"services":[],"category":["在地藝文"],"update_time":"2019-11-12 11:01:10"},{"id":5888,"lang":"en","name":"Wanziliao Sandbank(網仔寮沙洲)","summary":"","introduction":"It is a coastal sandbank and a barrier in the middle section of Qigu inland sea.

The wasters between Anping and Tainan coast was called the Taijiang Bay with water at 5-6m deep where large vessels could sail across. Anping is one of a series of sandbanks originally called Yikunshen. There are another six sandbanks between Anping and the estuary of the Erren River. All seven sandbanks were called one to seven Kunshen&rsquo;s. Anping and Beixianwei (Bassemboy) sandbank are separated by waters. As it is the passage to the Taijiang Bay, the Dutch built Zeelandia (Anping old Fort) to safeguard the passage. The Luermen River separating the north of Beixianwei and Xixinggang sandbanks is another passage to the Taijiang Bay.\r\n\r\nThe coast of the old Anping Harbor formed by sand. When it pours, the flood will carry the sand from the upper course to the lower course. As the sand blocked by the wind and wave of the Taiwan Strait deposits in place and forms a long and narrow sandbank. The left and the right sandbanks were formed at sea at 2km off the National Tainan Senior Marine Fishery Vocational School. These sand banks border Xiakunshan in Tainan City in the south and link Anshun Village in Xinfeng (Annan District today). Although a bay is formed, due to the tidal and wind direction changes in the four seasons, both sandbanks (old Anping Harbor) are about 400m apart. As the harbor is a shallow sandbank, waves are common. Although waters come across, the deepest part is only 1m at the low tide, and changes are common. When waves begin, the location of the watercourse changes completely. Due to mud and sand deposits, the straight line between the old harbor to the old canal in Tainan City is extremely shallow. This straight-line watercourse has thus become the Tainan City Drainage. &nbsp; The watercourse between the lower course of the Yanshui River, the passage to the old canal, and the harbor has been blocked by sand carried down by the flood, and the canal&rsquo;s function was lost. A harbor engineering project was implemented in 1931 to cut away the sandbank peninsula at about 1km south of the old harbor to connect with the new canal, in order to build the new Anping Harbor. The project was initiated in October 1935 and completed in March 1938 after 29 months. Although the scale was not large, compared to the depth of the old harbor at 3m during low tide, the new harbor occupies an area of 100m allows free access of passenger and goods vessels and sailing boats at low tide. Levees were built along the watercourses on the south and north banks of the harbor. At the end of the levees there are two diversion dikes of 160m long, and light signals were equipped at the tip of each dike. &nbsp;","open_time":"Open all day","district":"Anping Dist.","address":"708, , Anping Dist., 臺南市 Taiwan R.O.C","tel":"+886-6-2213597","fax":"","lat":22.98647,"long":120.14938,"services":[],"category":["在地藝文"],"update_time":"2019-11-12 10:31:04"},{"id":5942,"lang":"en","name":"Liren Elementary School Zhongxiao Building(立人國小忠孝樓)","summary":"","introduction":"This special building always attracts people walking across Ximen Road.
